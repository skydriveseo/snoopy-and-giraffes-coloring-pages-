					<h2>Snoopy coloring pages: Snoopy is Charlie Brown's best friend</h2>
					<p>We often see pictures of Snoopy in children's toy stores. This dog has been inspired and created into toys, fashion, or even school supplies for children. Snoopy has become a cartoon character that generations of children worldwide know. So what cartoon character is Snoopy? Let's discover the unique story of this dog!</p>
					<p>Based on the popular comic book series from the 1950s, 20th Century Fox brought Snoopy and his owner Charlie Brown to the big screen with "The Peanuts Movie."</p>
					<p>Peanut is a miniature of society. The film is about life through the lens of a group of children, with their lives and classes, without the presence of adults. The main character is Charlie Brown. He is clumsy and self-deprecating. The boy doesn't know how to fly a kite, kick a soccer ball, or play baseball like his friends. But Charlie Brown has his best friend: the white dog Snoopy; although he does not own any treasures, he always wholeheartedly encourages and helps the owner.</p>
					<p>Snoopy has especially loved in Peanuts thanks to its friendly, cute appearance, pure white fur, and round belly. He loves to wear a pilot's hat and dreams of one day flying an airplane. The clear and funny childhood world through the simple drawings of Charles Schulz is why Peanuts are still loved today.</p>
					<p>In Peanuts, we can get to know other lovable characters. Linus: is Charlie Brown's neighbor and best friend. Linus is like an " old man" who always philosophizes about everything. He often clutches the blanket beside him and strongly believes in Mr. Pumpkin. Lucy: is Linus' sister, grimacing and bossy, always dreaming of becoming President or Queen. Lucy loves giving advice to people, hates being licked by Snoopy, and makes fun of Linus and Charlie Brown.</p>

					<h2>Giraffe coloring pages: Let's discover the magic neck of the giraffe together!</h2>
					<p>Giraffes are exciting animals as they possess very long necks. They are humorously named "supermodels" by humans. Have you seen giraffes in the zoo or discovered these animals on TV? Before coloring the <a href="https://coloringpagesonly.com/pages/giraffes-coloring-pages"><strong>Giraffe coloring pages</strong></a>, let's find out this animal's characteristics and surprising facts!</p>
					<p>We can only find giraffes in Africa, and this is an animal with many unique features, from appearance to behavior.</p>
					<p>The giraffe is the tallest animal in the world. Baby giraffes can stand within 30 minutes of birth and are capable of running alongside other giraffes after 10 hours. Giraffes have very long necks, and their skin has spots. However, no two giraffes have the same set of spots.</p>
					<p>The hair on the giraffe's tail is very thick. The hairs on the giraffe's tongue allow them to eat things with spines. Their food is mainly left. Males establish dominance by headbutting. Males can have up to three horns on their heads. Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up, even when giving birth and sleeping. Giraffes have a minimal need for sleep and rest from 10 minutes to two hours daily.</p>
					<p>Giraffes are social animals and rarely fight with each other. Baby giraffes are nurtured until they are five months old. Giraffes have four stomachs that help them digest food. The spots and feathers on the giraffe's skin act as a good camouflage against predators. The most challenging thing for giraffes is to drink water; they must kneel their front legs, lowering their necks. Therefore, giraffes rarely drink water; they eat leaves containing a lot of water to get nutrition from it.</p>
					<p>The giraffe is a highly cautious animal. It has developed its sight and hearing to perfection. Thanks to its long neck, it can observe large areas and notice an approaching predator.</p>
					<p>The image of giraffes appearing in cartoons that children watch has a unique, impressive, adorable appearance and a gentle, cheerful, and sociable temperament, so it causes a lot of sympathy for babies. Therefore, when learning to paint with this animal subject, children will find exciting and fun things, making learning more attractive and attractive, and they will better absorb the lesson.</p>
